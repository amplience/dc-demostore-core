# V5.0.0 Upgrade

## ⚠️ Breaking change v5.0.0 (after v4.3.0) ⚠️

A breaking change was introduced _after_ version `v4.3.0` of this demostore FE due to depencies on the latest version of [dc-demostore-automation](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-automation) `v5.0.0`

In order for your demostore to function, you need the following:

1. Automation should use latest automation `v5.0.0` from [dc-demostore-automation](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-automation) using the lastest version of [dc-demostore-cli](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-cli)
2. Latest version of the dc-demostore-core FE from [dc-demostore-core](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-core)

### Recommended Upgrade path

This path assumes that you already have an Amplience Dynamic Content account with content and a deployed URL in Vercel.

1. Get latest version of dc-demostore-cli from npm

`npm update @amplience/dc-demostore-cli` or if you installed globally `npm update @amplience/dc-demostore-cli -g`

Once updated you can validate you are on the latest version by running the following command and checking that it matches the latest release on this github page:

```
demostore --version
```

2. Clean your Amplience Dynamic Content account to start from a blank canvas

`demostore cleanup -c -a`

3. Import from latest automation set

`demostore import -l`

See [import](../README.md#import) for details needed to update your front end

4. Update your front end [dc-demostore-core](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-core) to the latest version and deploy using the right environment variables

### Staying on an older version

Deployed versions will continue to work if you are not changing anything.
