# Requesting a DC Demo Store Core Environment

## With Amplience Access

If you already have access to Amplience as a customer / partner, the process is very straight forward.

1. Login to your support portal [https://support.amplience.com](https://support.amplience.com/). If you don't have a log in, you can self register.
2. Choose a new "New DC Demo Store Core" from your service catalog.
3. Fill out the details
    - You can choose between a brand new account or attaching a new [Hub](https://amplience.com/docs/intro/hubsandrepositories.html#hubs) to your existing instance.
    - Don't worry, if your existing agreement with Amplience does not have all of the modules used, one of the team will be in contact to help you.

Once your account is setup, you will have all of the required information to automate.
